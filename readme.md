# Space IRS

### By the Galactic Federation of Tax People

This is Galactic Federations tax website...

## Running Site

### Database

Load schema.sql and example_data.sql onto a sequel database.

### Server

Run the SpaceIRSApp.java file

### Website

First you need to install the node packages, this is done by running...

```
npm i
```

Then if you wish only to host the website run...

```
npm run host
```

However if you are going to be editing the code run

```
npm run dev
```

This is so tailwind continues to update it's tailout.css file.

### Test

Load test_schema.sql file to run test methods.
